List of Acquisitions/Thunderjet Team modules:
```{r}
modules <- c("ui-orders", "mod-orders", "edge-oai-pmh", "mod-oai-pmh", "edge-orders", "mod-inventory", "mod-gobi", "ui-vendors")
```


Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
folio_network(modules, TRUE)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
folio_network(modules, FALSE, FALSE)
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
